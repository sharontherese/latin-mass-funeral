This is the third in a series of websites on traditional Catholic sacraments, [Latin Mass Wedding](https://www.latinmasswedding.com/) and [Latin Mass Baptism](https://www.latinmassbaptism.com/) being the first two. 

It's intended to provide those interested with the rites and liturgies for Catholic burials, as well as common blessings, customs, and rubrics. Whenever possible, I include both the Latin and the English text. 

Most pages have an “About” section at the top, to provide context.

I also have a [personal site](https://sharonkabel.com) of my research and writing. Feel free to contact me there, if you spot a mistake, have a question, or want to recommend a resource.
