The Office for the Dead may be preceded by the first part of the [Rite of Burial for Adults](/rite-of-burial-for-adults/), and followed by the [Requiem Mass](/requiem-mass/).

The full Office for the Dead is Vespers, Matins, and Lauds. 

The Latin and English texts below are from a Book of Hours[^1].

# Officium Pro Defunctis

Dicitur integrum cum Invitatorio et tribus Nocturnis, et Antiphonae duplicantur, tam ad Vesperas, quam ad Matutinum, in die omnium Fidelium defunctorum, in die Depositionis, et in Anniversario alicuius defuncti, cum una tantum Oratione, ut infra, et ad Vesperas omittitur Psalmus, Lauda anima mea, et ad Laudes, De profundis, reliquo anni tempore dicitur officium, ut est notatum.

## Ad Vesperas

Absolute incipitur:

Ant: Placebo Domino.

Psalmus 114

Dilexi, quoniam exaudiet Dominus: vocem orationis meae.

Quia inclinavit aurem suam mihi: et in diebus meis invocabo.

Circumdederunt me dolores mortis: pericula inferni invenerunt me.

Tribulationem, et dolorem inveni: et nomen Domini invocavi.

O Domine, libera animam meam, misericors Dominus, et iustus: et Deus noster miseretur.

Custodiens parvulos Dominus: humiliatus sum, et liberavit me.

Convertere anima mea in requiem tuam: quia Dominus benefecit tibi.

Quia eripuit animam meam de morte: oculos meos a lacrymis, pedes meos a lapsu.

Placebo Domino: in regione vivorum.

Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine: et lux perpetua luceat eis.

Ant: Placebo Domino in regione vivorum.

Ant: Heu mihi.

Psalmus 119

Ad Dominum cum tribularer, clamavi: et exaudivit me.

Domine libera animam meam a labiis iniquis: et a lingua dolosa.

Quid detur tibi, aut quid apponatur tibi: ad linguam dolosam?

Sagittae potentis acutae: cum carbonibus desolatoriis.

Heu mihi, quia incolatus meus prolongatus est, habitavi cum habitantibus Cedar: multum incola fuit anima mea.

Cum his, qui oderunt pacem, eram pacificus: cum loquebar illis, inpugnabant me gratis.

Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine: et lux perpetua luceat eis.

Ant: Heu mihi Domine, quia incolatus meus prolongatus est.

Ant: Dominus.

Psalmus 120

Levavi oculos meos in montes: unde veniet auxilium mihi.

Auxilium meum a Domino: qui fecit caelum et terram.

Non det in commotionem pedem tuum: neque dormitet, qui custodit te.

Ecce non dormitabit: neque dormiet, qui custodit Israel.

Dominus custodit te, Dominus protectio tua: super manum dexteram tuam.

Per diem sol non uret te: neque luna per noctem.

Dominus custodit te ab omni malo: custodiat animam tuam Dominus.

Dominus custodiat introitum tuum, et exitum tuum: ex hoc nunc, et usque in saeculum.

Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine: et lux perpetua luceat eis.

Ant: Dominus custodiat te ab omni malo, custodiat animam tuam Dominus.

Ant: Si iniquitates.

Psalmus 129

De profundis clamavi ad te Domine: Domine exaudi vocem meam.

Fiant aures tuae intendentes: in vocem deprecationis meae.

Si iniquitates observaveris Domine: Domine quis sustinebit?

Quia apud te propitiatio est: et propter legem tuam sustinui te Domine.

Sustinuit anima mea in verbo eius: speravit anima mea in Domino.

A custodia matutina usque ad noctem: speret Israel in Domino.

Quia apud Dominum misericordia: et copiosa apud eum redemptio.

Et ipse redimet Israel: ex omnibus iniquitatibus eius.

Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine: et lux perpetua luceat eis.

Ant: Si iniquitates observaveris Domine, Domine quis sustinebit?

Ant: Opera.

Psalmus 137

Confitebor tibi Domine in toto corde meo: quoniam audisti verba oris mei.

In conspectu angelorum psallam tibi: adorabo ad templum sanctum tuum, et confitebor nomini tuo.

Super misericordia tua, et veritate tua: quoniam magnificasti super omne nomen sanctum tuum.

In quacumque die invocavero te, exaudi me: multiplicabis in anima mea virtutem.

Confiteantur tibi Domine omnes reges terrae: quia audierunt omnia verba oris tui.

Et cantent in viis Domini: quoniam magna est gloria Domini.

Quoniam excelsus Dominus, et humilia respicit: et alta a longe cognoscit.

Si ambulavero in medio tribulationis, vivificabis me: et super iram inimicorum meorum extendisti manum tuam, et salvum me fecit dextera tua.

Dominus retribuet pro me, Domine misericordia tua in saeculum: opera manuum tuarum ne despicias.

Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine: et lux perpetua luceat eis.

Ant: Opera manuum tuarum Domine ne despicias.

V: Audivi vocem de caelo dicentem mihi.

R: Beati mortui qui in Domino moriuntur.

Ant: Omne.

Canticum Beatae Mariae Virginis 
Luc. 1

Magnificat: anima mea Dominum.

Et exultavit spiritus meus: in Deo salutari meo.

Quia respexit humilitatem ancillae suae: ecce enim ex hoc beatam me dicent omnes generationes.

Quia fecit mihi magna, qui potens est: et sanctum nomen eius.

Et misericordia eius, a progenie et progenies: timentibus eum.

Fecit potentiam in brachio suo: dispersit superbos mente cordis sui.

Deposuit potentes de sede: et exaltavit humiles.

Esurientes implevit bonis: et divites dimisit inanes.

Suscepit Israel puerum suum: recordatus misericordiae suae.

Sicut locutus est ad patres nostros: Abraham, et semini eius in saecula.

Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine: et lux perpetua luceat eis.

Ant: Omne, quod dat mihi Pater, ad me veniet, et eum qui venit ad me, non eiiciam foras.

Preces infrascriptae in ferialibus diebus dicuntur flexis genibus:

Pater noster, qui es in caelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum: adveniat regnum tuum: fiat voluntas tua, sicut in caelo et in terra: panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie et dimitte nobis debita nostra, sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris.

V: Et ne nos inducas in tentationem.

R: Sed libera nos a malo.

Psalmus 145

Lauda anima mea Dominum: laudabo Dominum in vita mea: psallam Deo meo quamdiu fuero.

Nolite confidere in principibus: in filiis hominum, in quibus non est salus.

Exibit spiritus eius, et revertetur in terram suam: in illa die peribunt omnes cogitationes eorum.

Beatus cuius Deus Iacob adiutor eius, spes eius in Domino Deo ipsius: qui fecit caelum et terram, mare et omnia quae in eis sunt.

Qui custodit veritatem in saeculum, facit iudicium iniuriam patientibus: dat escam esurientibus.

Dominus solvit conpeditos: Dominus illuminat caecos.

Dominus erigit elisos: Dominus diligit iustos.

Dominus custodit advenas, pupillum et viduam suscipiet: et vias peccatorum disperdet.

Regnabit Dominus in saecula, Deus tuus Sion: in generatione et generationem.

Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine: et lux perpetua luceat eis.

V: A porta inferi.

R: Erue Domine animas eorum.

V: Requiescant in pace.

R: Amen.

V: Domine exaudi orationem meam.

R: Et clamor meus ad te veniat.

Oratio

Deus, qui inter Apostolicos sacerdotes famulos tuos pontificali seu sacerdotali fecisti dignitate vigere: praesta quaesumus: ut eorum quoque perpetuo aggregentur consortio.

Deus veniae largitor et humanae salutis amator, quaesumus clementiam tuam: ut nostrae congregationis fratres, propinquos, et benefactores, qui ex hoc saeculo transierunt, beata Maria semper virgine intercedente cum omnibus sanctis tuis, ad perpetuae beatitudinis consortium pervenire concedas. Fidelium Deus omnium conditor, et redemptor animabus famulorum, famularumque tuarum remissionem cunctorum tribue peccatorum: ut indulgentiam, quam semper optaverunt, piis supplicationibus consequantur. Qui vivis et regnas in saecula saeculorum.

R: Amen.

V: Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine.

R: Et lux perpetua luceat eis.

V: Requiescant in pace.

R: Amen.

## Ad Matutinum

Dicitur sequens Invitatorium in die Commemorationis omnium defunctorum, et quoties dicuntur tres Nocturni, ut supra, aliis vero temporibus omittitur, et inchoatur ab Antiphona Psalmorum Nocturni, et dicitur tantum unum Nocturnum cum suis Laudibus, hoc ordine: Secunda et quinta feria, primum Nocturnum. Tertia et sexta, secundum Nocturnum. Quarta feria et Sabbatho, tertium Nocturnum.

Invitatorium:

Regem, cui omnia vivunt, Venite adoremus.

Et repetitur:

Regem, cui omnia vivunt, Venite adoremus.

Psalmus 94

Venite exultemus Domino, iubilemus Deo salutari nostro: praeoccupemus faciem eius in confessione: et in psalmis iubilemus ei.

Regem, cui omnia vivunt, Venite adoremus.

Quoniam Deus magnus Dominus, et rex magnus super omnes deos: quoniam non repellet Dominus plebem suam: quia in manu eius sunt omnes fines terrae: et altitudines montium ipse conspicit.

Venite adoremus.

Quoniam ipsius est mare, et ipse fecit illud: et aridam fundaverunt manus eius: venite adoremus, et procidamus ante Deum: ploremus coram Domino, qui fecit nos: quia ipse est Dominus Deus noster:nos autem populus eius, et oves pascuae eius.

Regem, cui omnia vivunt, Venite adoremus.

Hodie si vocem eius audieritis, nolite obdurare corda vestra, sicut in exacerbatione secundum diem tentationis in deserto: ubi tentaverunt me patres vestri: probaverunt, et viderunt opera mea.

Venite adoremus.

Quadraginta annis proximus fui generationi huic: et dixi, semper hi errant corde: ipsi vero non cognoverunt vias meas: quibus iuravi in ira mea, si introibunt in requiem meam.

Regem, cui omnia vivunt, Venite Adoremus.

Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine: et lux perpetua luceat eis.

Venite adoremus.

Regem, cui omnia vivunt, Venite adoremus.

## Ad Laudes

Ant: Exultabunt Domino.

Psalmus 50

Miserere mei Deus: secundum magnam misericordiam tuam.

Et secundum multitudinem miserationum tuarum: dele iniquitatem meam.

Amplius lava me ab iniquitate mea: et a peccato meo munda me.

Quoniam iniquitatem meam ego cognosco: et peccatum meum contra me est semper.

Tibi soli peccavi, et malum coram te feci: ut iustificeris in sermonibus tuis, et vincas cum iudicaris.

Ecce enim in iniquitatibus conceptus sum: et in peccatis concepit me mater mea.

Ecce enim veritatem dilexisti: incerta et occulta sapientiae tuae manifestasti mihi.

Asperges me hyssopo, et mundabor: lavabis me, et super nivem dealbabor.

Auditui meo dabis gaudium, et laetitiam: et exultabunt ossa humiliata.

Averte faciem tuam a peccatis meis: et omnes iniquitates meas dele.

Cor mundum crea in me Deus: et spiritum rectum innova in visceribus meis.

Ne proicias me a facie tua: et spiritum sanctum tuum ne auferas a me.

Redde mihi laetitiam salutaris tui: et spiritu principali confirma me.

Docebo iniquos vias tuas: et impii ad te convertentur.

Libera me de sanguinibus Deus, Deus salutis meae: et exultabit lingua mea iustitiam tuam.

Domine labia mea aperies: et os meum annunciabit laudem tuam.

Quoniam si voluisses, sacrificium dedissem utique: holocaustis non delectaberis.

Sacrificium Deo Spiritus contribulatus: cor contritum, et humiliatum Deus non despicies.

Benigne fac Domine in bona voluntate tua Sion: et aedificentur muri Hierusalem.

Tunc acceptabis sacrificium iustitiae, oblationes, et holocausta: tunc inponent super altare tuum vitulos.

Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine: et lux perpetua luceat eis.

Ant: Exultabunt Domino ossa humiliata.

Ant: Exaudi Domine.

Psalmus 64

Te decet hymnus Deus in Sion: et tibi reddetur votum in Hierusalem.

Exaudi orationem meam: ad te omnis caro veniet.

Verba iniquorum praevaluerunt super nos: et impietatibus nostris tu propitiaberis.

Beatus quem elegisti, et assumpsisti: inhabitabit in atriis tuis.

Replebimur in bonis domus tuae: sanctum est templum tuum, mirabile in aequitate.

Exaudi nos Deus salutaris noster: spes omnium finium terrae, et in mari longe.

Praeparans montes in virtute tua accinctus potentia: qui conturbas profundum maris, sonum fluctuum eius.

Turbabuntur, gentes et timebunt qui inhabitant terminos a signis tuis: exitus matutini et vesperae delectabis.

Visitasti terram, et inebriasti eam: multiplicasti locupletare eam.

Flumen Dei repletum est aquis: parasti cibum illorum, quoniam ita est praeparatio eius.

Rivos eius inebrians multiplica genimina eius: in stillicidiis eius laetabitur germinans.

Benedices coronae anni benignitatis tuae, et campi tui replebuntur ubertate.

Pinguescent speciosa deserti: et exultatione colles accingentur.

Induti sunt arietes ovium, et valles abundabunt frumento: clamabunt, etenim hymnum dicent.

Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine: et lux perpetua luceat eis.

Ant: Exaudi Domine orationem meam, ad te omnis caro veniet.

Ant: Me suscepit.

Psalmus 62

Deus Deus meus: ad te de luce vigilo.

Sitivit in te anima mea: quam multipliciter tibi caro mea.

In terra deserta, invia, et inaquosa, sic in sancto apparui tibi: ut viderem virtutem tuam et gloriam tuam.

Quoniam melior est misericordia tua super vitas: labia mea laudabunt te.

Sic benedicam te in vita mea: et in nomine tuo levabo manus meas.

Sicut adipe, et pinguidine repleatur anima mea: et labiis exultationis laudabit os meum.

Sic memor fui tui super stratum meum, in matutinis meditabor in te: quia fuisti adiutor meus.

Et in velamento alarum tuarum exultabo, adhaesit anima mea post te: me suscepit dextera tua.

Ipsi vero in vanum quaesierunt animam meam, introibunt in inferiora terrae: tradentur in manus gladii, partes vulpium erunt.

Rex vero laetabitur in Deo, laudabunturomnes, qui iurant in eo: quia obstructum est os loquentium iniqua.

Psalmus 66

Deus misereatur nostri, et benedicat nobis: illuminet vultum suum super nos, et misereatur nostri.

Ut cognoscamus in terra viam tuam: in omnibus gentibus salutare tuum.

Confiteantur tibi populi Deus: confiteantur tibi populi omnes.

Laetentur et exultent gentes, quoniam iudicas populos in aequitate: et gentes in terra dirigis.

Confiteantur tibi populi Deus, confiteantur tibi populi omnes: terra dedit fructum suum.

Benedicat nos Deus, Deus noster, benedicat nos Deus: et metuant eum omnes fines terrae.

Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine: et lux perpetua luceat eis.

Ant: Me suscepit dextera tua Domine.

Ant: A porta inferi.

Canticum Ezechiae 

Isaia 38

Ego dixi in dimidio dierum meorum: vadam ad portas inferi.

Quaesivi residuum annorum meorum : dixi, non videbo Dominum Deum in terra viventium.

Non aspiciam hominem ultra: et habitatorem quietis.

Generatio mea ablata est: et convoluta est a me, quasi tabernaculum pastorum.

Praecisa est velut a texente vita mea, dum adhuc ordirer, succidit me: de mane usque ad vesperam finies me.

Sperabam usque ad mane: quasi leo sic contrivit omnia ossa mea.

De mane usque ad vesperam finies me: sicut pullus hirundinis, sic clamabo, meditabor ut columba.

Attenuati sunt oculi mei: suspicientes in excelsum.

Domine vim patior, responde pro me: quid dicam, aut quid respondebit mihi, cum ipse fecerim?

Recogitabo tibi omnes annos meos: in amaritudine animae meae.

Domine si sic vivitur, et in talibus vita spiritus mei, corripies me, et vivificabis me: ecce in pace amaritudo mea amarissima.
Tu autem eruisti animam meam ut non periret: proiecisti post tergum tuum omnia peccata mea.

Quia non infernus confitebitur tibi, neque mors laudabit te: non expectabunt qui descendunt in lacum, veritatem tuam.

Vivens vivens ipse confitebitur tibi, sicut et ego hodie: pater filiis notam faciet veritatem tuam.

Domine salvum me fac: et psalmos nostros cantabimus cunctis diebus vitae nostrae, in domo Domini.

Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine: et lux perpetua luceat eis.

Ant: A porta inferi erue Domine animam meam.

Ant: Omnis spiritus.

Psalmus 148

Laudate Dominum de caelis: laudate eum in excelsis.

Laudate eum omnes angeli eius: laudate eum omnes virtutes eius.

Laudate eum Sol et Luna: laudate eum omnes stellae et lumen.

Laudate eum caeli caelorum: et aquae quae super caelos sunt, laudent nomen Domini.

Quia ipse dixit, et facta sunt: ipse mandavit, et creata sunt.

Statuit ea in aeternum, et in saeculum saeculi: praeceptum posuit, et non praeteribit.

Laudate Dominum de terra: dracones et omnes abyssi.

Ignis, grando, nix, glacies, spiritus procellarum, quae faciunt verbum eius.

Montes, et omnes colles: ligna fructifera, et omnes cedri.

Bestiae, et universa pecora: serpentes, et volucres pennatae.

Reges terrae, et omnes populi: principes, et omnes iudices terrae.

Iuvenes, et virgines, senes cum iunioribus laudent nomen Domini: quia exaltatum est nomen eius solius.

Confessio eius super caelum et terram: et exaltavit cornu populi sui.

Hymnus omnibus Sanctis eius, filiis Israel: populo appropinquanti sibi.

Psalmus 149

Cantate Domino canticum novum: laus eius in ecclesia Sanctorum.

Laetetur Israel in eo, qui fecit eum: et filiae Sion exultent in Rege suo.

Laudent nomen eius in choro: in tympano, et psalterio psallant ei.

Quia beneplacitum est Domino in populo suo: et exaltavit mansuetos in salutem.

Exultabunt Sancti in gloria: laetabuntur in cubilibus suis.

Exultationes Dei in gutture eorum: et gladii ancipites in manibus eorum.

Ad faciendam vindictam in nationibus: increpationes in populis.

Ad alligandos reges eorum in compedibus: et nobiles eorum in manicis ferreis.

Ut faciant in eis iudicium conscriptum: gloria haec est omnibus Sanctis eius.

Psalmus 150

Laudate Dominum in Sanctis eius: laudate eum in firmamento virtutis eius.

Laudate eum in virtutibus eius: laudate eum secundum multitudinem magnitudinis eius.

Laudate eum in sono tubae: laudate eum in psalterio et cithara.

Laudate eum in tympano et choro: laudate eum in chordis, et organo.

Laudate eum in cymbalis bene sonantibus, laudate eum in cymbalis iubilationis: omnis spiritus laudet Dominum.

Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine: et lux perpetua luceat eis.

Ant: Omnis spiritus laudet Dominum.

V: Audivi, vocem de caelo dicentem mihi.

R: Beati mortui qui in Domino moriuntur.

Ant: Ego sum.

Canticum 

Zachariae Luc. 1

Benedictus Dominus Deus Israel: quia visitavit, et fecit redemptionem plebis suae.

Et erexit cornu salutis nobis: in domo David pueri sui.

Sicut locutus est per os sanctorum: qui a saeculo sunt prophetarum eius.

Salutem ex inimicis nostris: et de manu omnium qui oderunt nos.

Ad faciendam misericordiam cum patribus nostris: et memorari testamenti sui sancti.

Iusiurandum, quod iuravit ad Abraham patrem nostrum: daturum se nobis.

Ut sine timore de manu inimicorum nostrorum liberati: serviamus illi.

In sanctitate et iustitia coram ipso: omnibus diebus nostris.

Et tu puer, propheta Altissimi vocaberis: praeibis enim ante faciem Domini, parare vias eius.

Ad dandam scientiam salutis plebi eius: in remissionem peccatorum eorum.

Per viscera misericordiae Dei nostri: in quibus visitavit nos oriens ex alto.

Illuminare his, qui in tenebris et in umbra mortis sedent: ad dirigendos pedes nostros in viam pacis.

Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine: et lux perpetua luceat eis.

Ant: Ego sum resurrectio et vita: qui credit in me, etiam si mortuus fuerit, vivet, et omnis qui vivit, et credit in me, non morietur in aeternum.

Preces infrascriptae in Ferialibus diebus dicuntur flexis genibus, secreto:

Pater noster, qui es in caelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum: adveniat regnum tuum: fiat voluntas tua, sicut in caelo et in terra: panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie et dimitte nobis debita nostra, sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris.

V: Et ne nos inducas in tentationem.

R: Sed liber nos a malo.

Psalmus 129

De profundis clamavi ad te Domine, Domine exaudi vocem meam.

Fiant aures tuae intendentes: in vocem deprecationis meae.

Si iniquitates observaveris Domine: Domine quis sustinebit?

Quia apud te propitiatio est: et propter legem tuam sustinui te Domine.

Sustinuit anima mea in verbo eius: speravit anima mea in Domino.

A custodia matutina usque ad noctem: speret Israel in Domino.

Quia apud Dominum misericordia: et copiosa apud eum redemptio.

Et ipse redimet Israel: ex omnibus iniquitatibus eius.

Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine: et lux perpetua luceat eis.

V: A porta inferi.

R: Erue Domine animas eorum.

V: Requiescant in pace.

R: Amen.

# Office for the Dead

It is to be said wholly, with the Invitatory and three Nocturnes, and the Antiphons doubled, as well at Vespers, as at Matins, on the day of all faithful departed, and the day of the departure, and the years day of anyone deceased, with one only prayer, as followeth, and at Vespers the Psalm, My soul praise, is to be omitted, and at Lauds the Psalm, From the depths, at other times of the year the office is said, as it is noted.

## At Vespers

Is absolutely begun:

Ant: I will please.

Psalm 114

I have loved, because our Lord: will hear the voice of my prayer.

Because he hath inclined his ear to me: and in my days I will call upon him.

The sorrows of death have compassed me: and the pains of hell have found me.

I have found tribulation, and sorrow: and I called on the name of our Lord.

O Lord, deliver my soul, merciful Lord, and just: and our God hath mercy.

Our Lord keepeth little ones: I was humbled, and he hath delivered me.

Turn O my soul into thy rest: because our Lord hath done good to thee.

Because he hath delivered my soul from death: my eyes from tears, my feet from sliding.

I will please our Lord in the country of the living.

Eternal rest give unto them O Lord: and let perpetual light shine unto them.

Ant: I will please our Lord in the country of the living.

Ant: Woe is me.

Psalm 119

When I was in tribulation I cried to our Lord: and he heard me.

O Lord Deliver my soul from unjust lips: and from a deceitful tongue.

What may be given to thee, or what may be added unto thee: to a deceitful tongue?

The sharp arrows of the mighty: with coals of desolation.

Woe is unto me, that my sojourning is prolonged, I have dwelt with the inhabitants of Cedar: my soul hath been much a sojourner.

With them, that hated peace, I was peaceable: when I spake to them, they impugned me without cause.

Eternal rest give unto them O Lord: and let perpetual light shine unto them.

Ant: Woe is me O Lord, that my abode is prolonged.

Ant: Our Lord.

Psalm 120

I have lifted up mine eyes unto the mountains: from whence help shall come to me.

My help is from our Lord: which made heaven and earth.

Let him not give thy foot to be moved: neither let him slumber that keepeth thee.

Lo he shall not slumber: nor sleep, that keepeth Israel.

Our Lord keepeth thee, our Lord is thy protection: upon thy right hand.

By day the sun shall not burn thee: nor the moon by night.

Our Lord doth keep thee from all evil: let our Lord keep thy soul.

Let our Lord keep thy coming in, and thy going out: from henceforth, now and forever.

Eternal rest give unto them O Lord: and let perpetual light shine unto them.

Ant: Our Lord doth keep thee from all evil, our Lord can keep thy soul.

Ant: If thou O Lord.

Psalm 129

From the depths I have cried to thee O Lord: Lord hear my voice.

Let thine ears be attentive: unto the voice of my petition.

If thou wilt observe iniquities O Lord: Lord who shall endure it?

Because with thee there is pitifulness: and for thy law I have expected thee O Lord.

My soul hath stayed in his word: my soul hath hoped in our Lord.

From the morning watch even until night: let Israel hope in our Lord.

Because with our Lord there is mercy: and with him plentiful redemption.

And he shall redeem Israel: from all his iniquities.

Eternal rest give unto them O Lord: and let perpetual light shine unto them.

Ant: If thou O Lord observe iniquities, O Lord who shall be able to endure it?

Ant: The works.

Psalm 137

I will confess to thee O Lord in my whole heart: because thou hast heard the words of my mouth.

In the sight of Angels I will sing to thee: I will adore toward thy holy temple, and will confess to thy name.

Upon thy mercy and thy truth: because thou hast magnified thy holy name above all things.

In what day soever I shall call on thee, hear me: thou shalt multiply strength in my soul.

Let all the Kings of the earth O Lord confess to thee: because they have heard all the words of thy mouth.

And let them sing in the ways of our Lord: because great is the glory of our Lord.

Because our Lord is high, and he beholdeth low things: and high things he knoweth far off.

If I shall walk in the midst of tribulation, thou wilt quicken me: and upon the wrath of mine enemies thou hast extended thy hand, and thy right hand hath saved me. 

Our Lord will repay for me, O Lord thy mercy is forever: despise not the works of thy hands.

Eternal rest give unto them O Lord: and let perpetual light shine unto them.

Ant: The works of thy hands despise not O Lord.

V: I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me.

R: Blessed are the dead which die in our Lord.

Ant: All.

The Song of the Blessed Virgin Mary 
Luke 1

My soul: doth magnify our Lord.

And my spirit hath rejoiced: in God my saviour.

Because he hath regarded the humility of his handmaid: for behold from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.

Because he that is mighty, hath done great things to me: and holy is his name.

And his mercy from generation unto generations: to them that fear him.

He hath shewed might in his arm: he hath dispersed the proud in the conceit of their heart.

He hath deposed the mighty from their seat: and hath exalted the humble.

The hungry he hath filled with good things: and the rich he hath sent away empty.

He hath received Israel his child: being mindful of his mercy.

As he spake to our fathers: to Abraham, and his seed forever.

Eternal rest give unto them O Lord: and let perpetual light shine unto them.

Ant: All, that my Father giveth me, shall come unto me, and he that cometh unto me, I will not cast forth.

The prayers hereafter set down are to be said on the working days kneeling:

V: And lead us not into temptation.

R: But deliver us from evil.

Psalm 145

My soul praise thou our Lord, I will praise our Lord in my life: I will sing to my God as long as I shall be.

Put not confidence in Princes: in the children of men, in whom there is no salvation.

His spirit shall go forth, and shall return into his earth: in that day all their cogitations shall perish.

Blessed is he whose God of Jacob is his helper his hope in our Lord his God: which made heaven and earth, the sea, and all things that are in them.

Which keepeth truth forever, doth judgement for them that suffer wrong, giveth food to the hungry.

Our Lord looseth the fettered: our Lord lighteneth the blind.

Our Lord lifteth up the bruised: our Lord loveth the just.

Our Lord keepeth strangers, the fatherless and widow he will receive: and the ways of sinners he shall destroy.

Our Lord shall reign forever, thy God O Sion: in generation and generation.

Eternal rest give unto them O Lord: and let perpetual light shine unto them.

O God, which among the Apostolic priests hast made thy servants to have power by pontifical or priestly dignity: Grant we beseech thee: that they may also be joined unto their perpetual society.

O God the giver of pardon, and the lover of human salvation, we beseech thy clemency: that thou grant the brethren of our congregation, kinsfolk, and benefactors, which are departed out of this world, blessed Mary ever virgin making intercession with all the saints, to come to the fellowship of eternal blessedness.

O God the creator, and redeemer of all the faithful, give unto the souls of thy servants men, and women remission of all their sins: that through Godly supplications they may obtain the pardon which they have always wished for. Who livest and reignest world without end.

## At Matins

The Invitatory following is said on the day of the memory of all the dead, and as often as the three Nocturnes are said as before, at other times it is omitted, and is begun at the Antiphon of the Psalms of the Nocturne, and one only Nocturne with the Lauds, is said in this order: On Monday and Thursday, the first Nocturne: Tuesday and Friday, the second Nocturne: Wednesday and Saturday, the third Nocturne.

Invitatory:

The King, unto whom all things do live, come let us adore.

And it is repeated:

The King, unto whom all things do live, come let us adore.

Psalm 94

Come let us rejoice unto our Lord, let us make joy to God our saviour: let us approach to his presence in confession, and in Psalms let us make joy unto him.
The king, unto whom all things do live, come let us adore.

For God is a great Lord, and a great King above all Gods: because our Lord repelleth not his people: for that in his hand are all the bounds of the earth, and he beholdeth the heights of the mountains.

Come let us adore.

For the sea is his, and he made it: and his hands founded the dry land: come let us adore, and fall down before God: let us weep before our Lord, that made us: because he is the Lord our God: we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.

The King, unto whom all things do live, come let us adore.

Today if ye shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation according to the day of temptation in the wilderness: where your fathers tempted me: proved, and saw my works.

Come let us adore.

Forty years was I nigh unto this generation: and said, they always err in heart: and they have not known my ways, to whom I swear in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest.

The King, unto whom all things do live, come let us adore.

Eternal rest give unto them O Lord: and let perpetual light shine unto them.

Come let us adore.

The King, unto whom all things do live, Come let us adore.

## At Lauds

Ant: To our Lord.

Psalm 50

Have mercy on me O God: according to thy great mercy.

And according to the multitude of thy tender mercies: blot out my iniquity.

Wash me more from my iniquity: and cleanse me from my sin.

Because I do know my iniquity: and my sin is always against me.

To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: that thou mayest be justified in thy words, and mayest overcome when thou art judged.

For behold I was conceived in iniquities: and my mother conceived me in sins.

For behold thou hast loved truth: the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me.

Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow.

To my hearing thou shalt give joy, and gladness: and humbled bones shall rejoice.

Turn away thy face from my sins: and blot out all my iniquities.

Create a clean heart in me O God: and renew a right spirit in my bowels.

Cast me not away from thy face: and thy holy spirit take not from me.

Render unto me the joy of thy salvation: and confirm me with a principal spirit.

I will teach the unjust thy ways: and the impious shall be converted unto thee.

Deliver me from bloods O God, the God of my salvation: and my tongue shall extol thy justice.

Thou O Lord wilt open my lips: and my mouth shall declare thy praise.

Because if thou wouldst have had sacrifice, I had verily given it: with whole burnt offerings thou wilt not be delighted.

A sacrifice to God is a troubled spirit: a contrite, and humble heart O God, thou wilt not despise.

Deal favourably O Lord, in thy good will with Sion: and let the walls of Jerusalem be built up.

Then shalt thou accept sacrifice of justice, oblations, and whole burnt offerings: then shall they lay calves upon thy altar.

Eternal rest give unto them, O Lord: and let perpetual light shine unto them.

Ant: To our Lord shall rejoice the humbled bones.

Psalm 64

An hymn O God becometh thee in Sion: and a vow shall be rendered to thee in Jerusalem.

Hear my prayer: all flesh shall come to thee.

The words of the wicked have prevailed upon us: and thou wilt be merciful to our impieties.

Blessed is he whom thou hast chosen and taken: he shall dwell in thy courts.

We shall be replenished in the good things of thy house: holy is thy temple, marvelous in equity.

Hear us O God our saviour: the hope of all the ends of the earth, and far in the sea.

Preparing mountains in thy strength girded with might: which troublest the depth of the sea, the sound of the waves thereof.

The Gentiles shall be troubled, and they that inhabit the borders shall be afraid of thy signs: the outgoings of the morning and evening thou shalt delight.

Thou hast visited the earth, and made it drunken: thou hast multiplied to enrich it.

The river of God is replenished with waters: thou hast prepared their meat, because so is the preparation thereof.

Drunken making her rivers, multiply her fruits; springing in her channels she shall rejoice.

Thou wilt bless the crown of the year of thy bounty: and thy fields shall be replenished with plenty.

The beautiful places of the wilderness shall be fat: and the little hills shall be girded about with joyfulness.

The rams of the sheep are clothed, and the vales shall abound with corn: they will cry, yea they will say an Hymn.

Eternal rest give unto them, O Lord: and let perpetual light shine unto them.

Ant: Hear O Lord my prayer all flesh shall come unto thee.

Ant: The right hand.

Psalm 62

O God my God: to thee I watch from the morning light.

My soul hath thirsted to thee: my flesh to thee very many ways.

In desert land, and inaccessible, and without water, so in the holy have I appeared to thee: that I might see thy strength, and thy glory.

Because thy mercy is better than lives: my lips shall praise thee.

So will I bless thee in my life: and in thy name I will lift up my hands.

As with lard and fatness let my soul be filled: and my mouth shall praise with lips of joyfulness.

So have I been mindful of thee upon my bed, in the morning I will meditate on thee: because thou hast been my helper.

And in the cover of thy wings I will rejoice, my soul hath cleaved after thee: thy right hand hath received me.

But they in vain have sought my soul, they shall be delivered into the hands of the sword, they shall be the portions of foxes.

But the King shall rejoice in God, all shall be praised, that swear in him: because the mouth is stopped of them that speak wicked things.

Psalm 66

God have mercy upon us, and bless us: illuminate his countenance upon us, and have mercy upon us.

That we may know thy way in earth: in all nations thy salvation.

Let peoples O God confess to thee: let all peoples confess to thee.

Let nations be glad and rejoice, because thou judgest peoples in equity: and the nations in the earth thou dost direct.

Let peoples O God confess to thee, let all peoples confess to thee: the earth hath yielded her fruit.

God our God bless us, God bless us: and let all the ends of the earth fear him.

Eternal rest give unto them, O Lord: and let perpetual light shine unto them.

Ant: Thy right hand O Lord hath received me.

Ant: From the gate of hell.

The Song of Ezechias 
Isaiah 38

I have said in the midst of my days, shall I go to the gates of hell.

I have sought the residue of my years: I have said, I shall not see our Lord God in the land of the living.

I shall behold man no more: and the inhabiter of rest.

My generation is taken away: and is wrapped up from me as the tents of shepherds.

My life is cut off as by a weaver, while I yet began, he cut me off: from morning unto night thou wilt make an end of me.

I hope even until the morning: as a lion so hath he broken all my bones.

From morning, until evening thou wilt make an end of me: as a young swallow, so will I cry, I will meditate as a dove.

Mine eyes are weakened: looking up on high.

Lord I suffer violence, answer for me: what shall I say or what shall he answer me, whereas myself have done it?

I will recount all my years: in the bitterness of my soul.

Lord if man's life be such, and the life of my spirit in such things, thou shalt chasten me, and shalt quicken me: behold in peace is my bitterness most bitter.

But thou hast delivered my soul that it should not perish: thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.

Because hell shall not confess to thee, neither shall death praise thee: they that go down into the lake, shall not expect thy truth.

The living the living he shall confess to thee, as I also this day: the father to the children shall make thy truth known.

O Lord save me: and we will sing our Psalms all the days of our life, in the house of our Lord.

Eternal rest give unto them, O Lord: and let perpetual light shine unto them.

Ant: From the gate of hell deliver my soul O Lord.

Ant: Let every spirit.

Psalm 148

Praise ye our Lord from the heavens: praise ye him in the high places.

Praise ye him all his angels: praise ye him all his powers.

Praise ye him Sun, and Moon: praise ye him all ye stars, and light.

Praise him ye heavens of heavens: and the waters that are above the heavens, let them praise the name of our Lord.

Because he said, and they were made: he commanded and they were created.

He established them for ever, and for ever and ever: he put a precept, and it shall not pass.

Praise our Lord from the earth: ye dragons and all depths.

Fire, hail, snow, ice, spirits of storms: which do his word.

Mountains and all little hills: trees that bear fruit, and all cedars.

Beasts, and all cattle: serpents, and feathered fowls.

Kings of the earth, and all peoples: princes, and all judges of the earth.

Young men, and virgins, old with young let them praise the name of our Lord: because the name of him alone is exalted.

The confession of him above heaven and earth: and he hath exalted the horn of his people.

An hymn to all his saints, to the sons of Israel: a people approaching unto him.

Psalm 149

Sing ye to our Lord a new song: his praise in the church of saints.

Let Israel be joyful in him, that made him: and let the daughters of Sion rejoice in their king.

Let them praise his name in dance: on timbrel, and psaltery let them sing to him.

Because our Lord is well pleased in his people: and he hath exalted the meek unto salvation.

The saints shall rejoice in glory: they shall be joyful in their beds.

The joyfulness of God in their throats and two-edged swords in their hands.

To do revenge in the nations: chastisements amongst his peoples.

To bind their kings in fetters: and their nobles in iron manacles.

That they may do in them the judgment that is written: this glory is to all his saints.

Psalm 150

Praise ye our Lord in his saints: praise him in the firmament of his strength.

Praise ye him in his powers: praise ye him according to the multitude of his greatness.

Praise ye him in the sound of trumpet: praise ye him on psaltery and harp.

Praise ye him on timbrel, and dance: praise ye him on strings and organs.

Praise ye him on well sounding cymbals, praise ye him on cymbals of joy: let every spirit praise our Lord.

Eternal rest give unto them, O Lord: and let perpetual light shine unto them.

Ant: Let every spirit praise our Lord.

V: I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me.

R: Blessed are the dead that die in Our Lord.

Ant: I am.

Song of Zacharia 

Luke 1

Blessed be our Lord God of Israel: because he hath visited and wrought the redemption of his people.

And hath erected the horn of salvation to us: in the house of David his servant.

As he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets: that are from the beginning.

Salvation from our enemies: and from the hand of all that hate us.

To work mercy with our fathers: and to remember his holy testament.

The oath, which he swore to Abraham our father: that he would give to us.

That without fear being delivered from the hand of our enemies: we may serve him.

In holiness and justice before him: all our days.

And thou child, shalt be called the prophet of the highest: for thou shalt go before the face of our Lord, to prepare his ways.

To give knowledge of salvation to his people: unto remission of their sins.

Through the bowels of the mercy of our God in which the orient from on high, hath visited us.

To illuminate them that sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death: to direct our feet into the way of peace.

Eternal rest give unto them, O Lord: and let perpetual light shine unto them.

Ant: I am the resurrection and the life: he which believeth in me, although he were dead, yet shall he live: and everyone which liveth, and believeth in me, shall not die forever.

The following prayers are to be said on week days, kneeling, in secret:

Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth, as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us.

V: And lead us not into temptation.

R: But deliver us from Evil.

Psalm 129

From the depths I have cried to thee O Lord: Lord hear my voice.

Let thine ears be attentive: unto the voice of my petition.

If thou wilt observe iniquities O Lord: Lord who shall endure it?

Because with thee there is pitifulness: and for thy law I have expected thee O Lord.

My soul hath stayed in his word: my soul hath hoped in our Lord.

From the morning watch even until night: let Israel hope in our Lord.

Because with our Lord there is mercy: and with him plentiful redemption.

And he shall redeem Israel: from all his iniquities.

Eternal rest give unto them, O Lord: and let perpetual light shine unto them.
