## Epistle

From the Book of the Apocalypse of Blessed John the Apostle, 5. 11-14.

In those days: I heard the voice of many Angels round about the throne, and the living creatures and the ancients; and the number of them was thousands of thou sands, saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain is worthy to receive power, and divinity, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and benediction. And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, I heard all saying: To Him that sitteth on the throne, and to the Lamb, benediction, and honor, and glory, and power, for ever and ever. And the four living creatures said: Amen. And the four and twenty ancients fell down on their faces, and adored Him that liveth for ever and ever.

At that time: Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him: and He saith of him: Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom there is no guile. Nathanael saith to Him: Whence knowest Thou me? Jesus answered, and said to him: Before that Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee. Nathanael answered Him, and said: Rabbi, Thou art the Son of God, Thou art the King of Israel. Jesus answered, and said to him: Because I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, thou believest: greater things than these shalt thou see.
