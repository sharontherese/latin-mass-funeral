# Purgatorial Societies 

Purgatorial societies or confraternities exist to offer Masses and pray for the souls in Purgatory. A similar practice is that of a chantry, a fund and/or chapel which a donor reserves for Mass to be said for their soul. 

For more information, consider contacting your local churches, diocese, or traditional orders to see if they have preexisting purgatorial soceties.

# Habsburg burials

Some of the most detailed descriptions we have of burial customs come from Catholic royal families. A notable example is the 'knocking ceremony' from the Habsburg family, as the deceased is brought to the Capuchin Church that houses the Imperial Crypt in Vienna. It has been seen most recently in the funeral of Otto von Habsburg in 2011. 

> The Grand Chamberlain knocks three times with a silver cane on the door of the Capuchin convent which contains the Imperial crypt. The Capuchin porter asks: “Who is there?”

> The Grand Chamberlain proclaims the name and titles of the deceased Hapsburg emperor: “I am (Name) … Emperor of Austria, Apostolic King of Hungary, King of Bohemia, Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Galicia, Lodomeria, of Illyria, and King of Jerusalem, Archduke of Austria, Grand Duke of Tuscany and Cracow, Duke of Lorraine , Salzburg, STIR, Carinthia, of Carniola and Bukovina, Grand Prince of Transylvania, Margrave of Moravia, Duke of Upper Silesia, Lower Silesia, of Modena, Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla, of Auschwitz and Zator of Ticino, Friuli, Ragusa and Zara, Prince of Conde-Hapsburg and Tyrol, of Kyburg, in Goritz and Gradisca, Prince of Trent and Brixen, Margrave of Upper and Lower Lusatia and Istria, Earl of Hohenembs of Feldkirch of Brigance, in Sonnenberg, Lord of Trieste, of Cattaro and Marche, Great Voivode of Serbia, etc.” Upon hearing this, the porter refuses to open the door and says: “I do not know you.”

> The Grand Chamberlain knocks on the door again and in answer to the porter’s question “Who is there?” gives just the name of the deceased prince: “I am (Name) … His Majesty the Emperor and the King.” The porter again refuses admission: “I do not know you.”

> For a third time, the Grand Chamberlain knocks on the door and the porter asks anew, “Who is there?” This time, the Grand Chamberlain simply says: “I am (Name)… a poor mortal and a sinner.” To this, the Capuchin friar responds: “Come in.”

# Ossuaries and catacombs

Ossuaries are resting places for remains, but are more famously known as "bone churches." They are visually striking "memento mori"s, with walls, chandeliers, and even entire buildings made from bones.
