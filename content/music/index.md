# About

The ideal music _setting_ for the Mass is _gregorian chant_, followed by _polyphony_. In a sung _Latin Mass_, or _high Mass_, what is sung are the _propers_ and _ordinaries_. Historically, hymns were discouraged in the Mass. Your Latin Mass wedding music will depend mostly on the musical resources available to your church.

Sancta Missa provides a 4-page Q&A booklet on Nuptial Mass music: 

Haynes, S.J.C., Reverend Scott A. “**Guidelines for Liturgical Services According to the 1962 Missale Romanum: Music for Nuptial High Mass**.” Biretta Books, 2007. https://sanctamissa.org/en/music/musical-guidelines-for-the-traditional-roman-rite/liturgical-services-music-for-the-nuptial-high-mass.pdf.

Here is how our wedding Mass music looked:

> **Prelude:**  
> _Veni Creator Spiritus_, Rabanus Maurus (gregorian chant)  
> _Alma Redemptoris_, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (polyphony)
>
> **Procession:**  
> _Te Deum_, Marc-Antoine Charpentier (organ)
>
> **Propers:**  
> all gregorian chant
>
> **Ordinaries:**  
> Mass setting VIII, Missa de Angelis (gregorian chant)
>
> **Offertory motet:**  
> Psalm 117 (gregorian chant)
>
> **Communion motet:**  
> _Sicut Cervus_, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina (polyphony)  
> _Te Deum_, Nicetas of Remesiana (gregorian chant)
>
> **Presentation of flowers to Mary:**  
> _Ave Verum Corpus_, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (polyphony)
>
> **Recessional:**  
> _O God Beyond All Praising_, Michael Perry (hymn)  
> _Organ Symphony No. 5, Toccata_, Charles-Marie Widor (organ)

## Polyphonic settings 

Polyphonic settings of the nuptial propers are one of the most difficult types of wedding music to find. The only concrete information on such settings I have found is in the Musica Sacra forums.

# Ordinaries

The _ordinaries_ are the Kyrie, Sanctus, and Agnus Dei (the Gloria and Credo are not included in the wedding Mass). 

## Gregorian chant settings

“**St. Antoine Daniel Kyriale**.” Corpus Christi Watershed. Accessed July 29, 2019. [http://www.ccwatershed.org/kyriale/](http://www.ccwatershed.org/kyriale/ "http://www.ccwatershed.org/kyriale/"). 

## Polyphonic settings

Unlike the paucity of polyphonic propers, there is an abundance of options for settings for the ordinaries. Below are some of the more famous settings, renowned for beauty and/or simplicity.

# Other Sacred Music

Below are a few popular choices for hymns, motets, and chants for the wedding Mass. Many of these texts have more than one setting. If you need inspiration, consider the background of you and your future spouse (French, Italian, Irish, etc.), or the feasts on/near your wedding day. If your wedding day is near, for example, St. Thomas Aquinas' feast day, you could choose one of the many songs he composed, or a song centered on the Eucharist, a common theme in St. Thomas' works.

## Marian chants

Alma Redemptoris Mater (Marian atiphon for: Advent through February 1) 

Ave, Regina Caelorum (Marian atiphon for: February 2 through Good Friday)

Regina Caeli (Marian atiphon for: during the season of Easter)

Salve Regina (Marian atiphon for: after Pentecost)

Ave maris stella
