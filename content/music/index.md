# Requiem Mass Settings

Settings for the Requiem Mass are some of the most haunting examples of sacred music. 

It has been set to music so many times that it is almost a genre unto itself. The website Requem Survey[^1] currently lists over 5,000 settings. 

# Dies Irae

The Dies irae is a _sequence_ for the Requiem Mass. It is considered to be the most beautiful sequence. It has been discussed and commented upon for centuries, perhaps best addressed in Father Nicholas Gihr's seminal work _Dies Irae_.[^2]
