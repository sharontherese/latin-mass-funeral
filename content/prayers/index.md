## Prayer of One about to be Married

O gracious Father, who dost bless us by Thy bounty, pardon us by Thy mercy, support and guide us by Thy grace, and govern us by Thy providence: I give Thee humble and hearty thanks for all the mercies which I have received at Thy hands in time past. And now, since Thou hast called me to the holy estate of marriage, be pleased to be with me in my entering into it and passing through it, that it may not be a state of temptation or sorrow to me by occasion of my sins or infirmities, but of holiness and comfort, of love and dutifulness, as Thou hast intended it to be to all that love and fear Thy holy name. Amen.

## A Husband’s Prayer

O gracious Father, Maker and Preserver of heaven and earth, who in the beginning didst institute matrimony, thereby foreshadowing the mystical union of the Church with our Saviour Christ, who, in the time of His ministry upon earth, did honor marriage with His first miracle: enable me, I pray Thee, by Thy grace to live in holiness and purity with the wife whom Thou hast given me. Mortify in me all violence of earthly passion, all selfishness and inconsiderateness (here name any besetting sin which may be a hindrance to you), that I may love her as Christ loved His Church, cherish and comfort her as my own body, and have as great care for her happiness as for my own. Grant that we may live in peace, without contention; in unity, without discord. (Give us, O Lord, discreet hearts and understanding minds, to bring up our children in Thy faith and fear, that they may be obedient to Thee and to Thy commandments, and to all 
that Thou requirest of them in duty towards their parents.) And give us, O Lord, a competency of estate, to maintain ourselves and our family according to that rank and calling wherein Thou hast placed us, without excess or vainglory, in singleness and pureness of heart. Grant this for Jesus Christ’s sakfe, to whom, with Thee and the Holy Ghost, be all honor and glory, now and for ever. Amen.

## A Wife’s Prayer

O merciful Lord God, who in the beginning didst take Eve out of the side of Adam and didst give her to him as a helpmate: give me grace to live worthy of the honorable estate of matrimony to which Thou hast called me, that I may love my husband with a pure and chaste love, acknowledging him as my head, and truly reverencing and obeying him in all good things; that thereby I may please him, and live with him in all Christian quietness. Keep me from all worldliness and vanity. Help me, O Lord, that I may, under him, prudently and discreetly guide and govern his household. Let no fault of mine aggravate any sins by which he may be especially tempted; enable me to soothe him in perplexity, to cheer him in difficulty, to refresh him in weariness, and, as far as may be, to advise him in doubt. (Give me understanding so to fulfil my part in the education of our children, that they may be our joy in this world and our glory in the next.) Grant that our perfect union here may be the beginning of the still more perfect and blissful union hereafter in Thy kingdom; and this I pray through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

## A Prayer to be said by Husband or Wife

O merciful God, we humbly beseech Thee to send Thy blessing continually upon us, and to make us thankful for all that Thou hast already vouchsafed unto us; and as Thou hast made us one in the mystical grace of matrimony, grant that we may be also inwardly of one heart and of one mind, paying due honor one to another, united in love to Thee and to each other in Thee; living together in peace and holiness, as faithful members of Thy Church, denying ourselves, and being a mutual help, comfort, and support to each other, all the days of our life. (Give us grace to train our children in Thy faith and fear.) Bless us with health and strength, if it be Thy will, and with whatever else Thy good providence shall see to be best for our souls and bodies. Fit and prepare us day by day for our departure hence, that we may together inherit eternal life in Thy heavenly kingdom. Through the merits of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour. Amen.

## Prayer for Divine Direction in the Choice of a State of Life 

Almighty God! Whose wise and amiable providence watches over every human event, deign to be my light and my counsel in all my undertakings, particularly in the choice of a state of life. I know that on this important step my sanctification and salvation may in a great measure depend. I know that I am incapable of discerning what may be best for me; therefore I cast myself into Thy arms, beseeching Thee, my God, Who hast sent me into this world only to love and serve Thee, to direct by Thy grace every action of my life to the glorious end of my creation. I renounce most sincerely every other wish than to fulfil Thy designs on my soul, whatever they may be; and I beseech Thee to give me the grace to be imbued with the spirit of Christ and to qualify myself for any state of life to which Thy adorable providence may call me. O my God! whenever it may become my duty to make a choice, do Thou be my light and my counsel, and mercifully deign to make the way known to me wherein I should walk, for I have lifted up my soul to Thee. Preserve me from listening to the suggestions of self-love, or worldly prudence, in prejudice to Thy holy inspirations. Let Thy good Spirit lead me into the right way, and let Thy adorable providence place me, not where I may naturally feel inclined to go, but where all things may be most conducive to Thy glory and to the good of my soul. Mary, Mother of Good Counsel, Seat of Wisdom, Help of Christians, pray for me. Amen.

## For the Master and Mistress of a Family

Merciful God, I implore thy grace for my direction and help, in the execution of every thing thou hast committed to my charge. Grant me discretion, that I may discover in all things what is best to be done, that I may manage them according to the obligations thou hast laid upon me. Make me faithful in taking care of what, under thee, I have in charge, that nothing may suffer through my neglect, idleness, prodigality, or ill management. Let not passion have any influence on my words or actions, that I may reprove without anger, command without imperiousness, require service without cruelty, have compassion on such failings as proceed rather from weakness than neglect, and show a tenderness towards all under my charge, as knowing that both they and I serve one master in heaven, who, without respect to persons, will call us all to an equal account. Lord, let me never want thy grace to suppress every inclination that leads me from my duty. Let no kind of extravagance, excess, or disorder find encouragement in my house. Make me a zealous observer of good discipline, and watchful against all undue liberties. Suffer me not to be unjust to any one, nor connive at what ought to be reproved. Take from me all immoderate solicitude, and let no excess of worldly care withdraw my heart from the important concern of eternity. May my chief solicitude be, how to regulate all my concerns to thy honor and glory. I crave thy blessing this day and forever, on all I am to do or suffer, and humbly offer myself, and all I possess, to thy glory. Help me, my God, according to my necessities, now and forever. Amen.

## For a Husband or Wife

God, who hast ordained the holy state of matrimony, wherein I am engaged, grant me grace to comply with all its obligations, and to perform them in such a manner as is becoming a Christian, not an unbeliever. Preserve my love undefiled, according to thy divine command, and let the duty of love help to conduct me with comfort through all the obligations and difficulties of my state. Grant me discretion to manage all circumstances for the best, a true love for peace, and such a discreet compliance as to resign my own thoughts and inclinations for preserving it. Inspire me with true humility and patience, that I may submit to and bear with all crosses in the manner thy apostle requires. Furnish me with all other helps, that whatever difficulties may occur, I may persevere with cheerfulness in discharging the duties of my state, and never yield so far to any weakness, ill-humor, or impatience, as to weaken, much less to break the bond which thou hast sanctified, and which cannot be dissolved but by death. May I always be faithful and indefatigable in the discharge of the duties of my state, doing and suffering whatever falls to my lot, with such absolute submission to thy will, that both in peace and trouble, in prosperity and adversity, I may ever remember to resign myself cheerfully, God, to thy pleasure or permission; and under all difficulties, still labor to work out my salvation.
