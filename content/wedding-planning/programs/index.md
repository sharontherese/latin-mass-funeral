# About 

Wedding programs can be an excellent way to familiarize, or at least introduce, your wedding Mass guests to the unique rites and traditions of the Latin Mass wedding. Programs can include any combination of information on: the wedding party, the couple's story, reception details, Mass texts, music, responses, and more. If you would like help creating a wedding program for a Latin Mass wedding, [contact me] (https://www.latinmasswedding.com/#contact) for a quote!
