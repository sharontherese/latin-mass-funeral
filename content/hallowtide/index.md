# About

Hallowtide is a short but colorful season near the end of the liturgical that runs from October 31-November 2. 

October 31 is the vigil of All Saints Day and Halloween, and as such carries a penitential character, with purple vestments.

November 1 is All Saints Day and a Holy Day of Obligation, with liturgical colors of white and gold, and at one point had its own octave. 

November 2 is All Souls Day, in mournful black. 

While the Catholic character of these days has been ensnarled and confused with secular celebrations, the days nonetheless have an old and vivid Catholic character. It has long been a pious custom during this season (and all of November) to visit cemeteries and pray for the dead. 

Below is a collection of resources on the celebration (both liturgical and domestic) of Hallowtide. 

For more articles, posts, photos, and videos of Hallowtide Masses, customs, vestments, and histories, see New Liturgical Movement and the Liturgical Arts Journal.
