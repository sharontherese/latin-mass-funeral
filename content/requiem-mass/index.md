# About

The Requiem Mass (_Missa Defunctorum_ or _Missa de Profunctis_) may be preceded by the first part of the [Rite of Burial for Adults](/rite-of-burial-for-adults/) and the [Office for the Dead](/office-for-the-dead/). 

The Requiem Mass is taken from the Mass for All Souls' Day. 

The Roman Missal offers additional Mass prayers for anniversaries of the day of death, and special prayers for clergy and kings. 

The Latin text below is directly from the _Rituale Romanum_[^1], and English text below is from Philip T. Weller's translation of it, the _Roman Ritual_[^2]. 

The Requiem Mass has a number of distinct elements, so many Catholic presses offer all-in-one Requiem Mass missals, kits, and handouts. A few are available here:

 # Missa Defunctorum
 
## Introit 

Esdr. 2: 34, 35

Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine. Et lux perpetua luceat eis. (Ps. 64, 2-3) Te decet hymnus, Deus, in Sion, Et tibi reddetur votum in Jerusalem. Exaudi orationem meam. ad te omnis caro veniet.

## Collect

Deus, cui proprium est misereri semper et parcere, te supplices exoramus pro anima famuli tui N. (famulae tuae N.), quam hodie de hoc saeculo migrare jussisti: ut non tradas eam in manus inimici, neque obliviscaris in finem, sed jubeas earn a Sanctis Angelis suscipi et ad patriam paradisi perduci; ut, quia in te speravit et credidit, non pcenas inferni sustineat, sed gaudia aaterna possideat. Per Dominum.

## Epistle 

1 Thess. 4: 13-18

Fratres: Nolumus vos ignorare de dormientibus, ut non contristemini, sicut et ceteri, qui spem non habent. Si enim credimus, quod Jesus mortuus est et resurrexit: ita et Deus eos, qui dormierunt per Jesum, adducet cum eo. Hoc enim vobis dicimus in verbo Domini, quia nos, qui vivimus, qui residui sumus in adventum Domini, non praeveniemus eos, qui dormierunt. Quoniam ipse Dominus in jussu, et in voce Archangeli, et in tuba Dei descendet de caelo: et mortui, qui in Christo sunt, resurgent primi. Deinde nos, qui vivimus, qui relinquimur, simul rapiemur cum illis in nubibus obviam Christo in aera, et sic semper cum Domino erimus. Itaque consolamini invicem in verbis istis.

## Gradual

Esdr. 2: 34, 35

Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine: et lux perpetua luceat eis. (V. Ps. 111:7.) In memoria aeterna erit iustus, ab auditione mala non timebit.

## Tract

Absolve, Domine, animas omnium fidelium defunctorum ab omni vinculo delictorum et gratia tua illis succurente mereantur evadere iudicium ultionis, et lucis aeternae beatitudine perfrui.

## Sequence

Dies irae, dies illa

Solvet saeclum in favilla,

Teste David cum Sibylla.

Quantus tremor est futurus,

Quando judex est venturus,

Cuncta stricte discussurus!

Tuba mirum spargens sonum

Per sepulcra regionum,

Coget omnes ante thronum.

Mors stupebit et natura,

Cum resurget creatura,

Judicanti responsura.

Liber scriptus proferetur,

In quo totum continetur,

Unde mundus judicetur.

Judex ergo cum sedebit,

Quidquid latet apparebit.

Nil inultum remanebit.

Quid sum miser tunc dicturus?

Quem patronum rogaturus,

Cum vix justus sit securus?

Rex tremendae majestatus

qui salvandos salvas gratis

sale me, fons pietatis

Recordare, Jesu pie,

Quod sum causa tuae viae:

Ne me perdas illa die.

Quaerens me, sedisti, lassus;

Redemisti crucem passus;

Tantus labor non sit cassus.

Juste Judex ultionis,

Donum fac remissionis

Ante diem rationis.

Ingemisco tanquam reus,

Culpa rubet vultus meus;

Supplicanti parce, Deus.

Qui Mariam absolvisti,

Et latronem exaudisti,

Mihi quoque spem dedisti.

Preces meae non sunt dignae,

Sed tu, bonus, fac benigne,

Ne perenni cremer igne.

Inter oves locum praesta,

Et ab hoedis me sequestra,

Statuens in parte dextra.

Confutatis maledictis

Flammis acribus addictis,

Voca me cum benedictus.

Oro supplex et acclinis,

Cor contritum quasi cinis,

Gere curam mei finis.

Lacrimosa dies illa,

Qua resurget ex favilla

Judicandus homo reus.

Huic ergo parce, Deus:

Pie Jesu Domine:

Dona eis requiem. Amen.

## Gospel

Joann. 11: 21-27

In illo tempore: Dixit Martha ad Jesum: Domine, si fuisses hie, frater meus non fuisset mortuus: sed et nunc scio, quia, quaecumque poposceris a Deo, dabit tibi Deus. Dicit illi Jesus: Resurget frater tuus. Dicit ei Martha: Scio, quia resurget in resurrectione in novissimo die. Dixit ei Jesus: Ego sum resurrectio et vita: qui credit in me, etiam si mortuus fuerit, vivet: et omnis, qui vivit et credit in me, non morietur in aeternum. Credis hoc? Ait illi: Utique, Domine, ego credidi, quia tu es Christus, Filius Dei vivi, qui in hunc mundum venisti.

## Offertory

Domine, Jesu Christe, Rex gloriae, libera animas omnium fidelium defunctorum de poenis inferni et de profundo lacu. Libera eas de ore leonis ne absorbeat eas tartarus, ne cadant in obscurum; Sed signifer sanctus Michael repraesentet eas in lucem sanctam, Quam olim Abrahae promisisti et semini eius. Hostias et preces tibi, Domine laudis offerimus tu suscipe pro animabus illis, quarum hodie memoriam facimus. Fac eas, Domine, de morte transire ad vitam. Quam olim Abrahae promisisti et semine eius.

## Agnus Dei

Agnus Dei, qui tollis pecatta mundi dona eis requiem. Agnus Dei, qui tollis pecatta mundi dona eis requiem. Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, dona eis requiem sempitername.

## Secret

Propitiare, quaesumus, Domine, animae famuli tui N. (famulae tuae N.), pro qua hostiam laudis tibi immolamus, majestatem tuam suppliciter deprecantes: ut, per haec piae placationis officia, pervenire mereatur ad requiem sempiternam. Per Dominum nostrum.

## Praefatio

Vere dignum et justum est, aequum et salutare, nos tibi semper et ubique gratias agere: Domine sancte, Pater omnipotens, aeterne Deus, per Christum Dominum nostrum. In quo nobis spes beatae resurrectionis effulsit: ut quos contristat certa moriendi conditio, eosdem consoletur futurae immortalitatis promissio. Tuis enim fidelibus, Domine, vita mutatur, non tollitur: et dissolute terrestris hujus incolatus domo, aeterna in caelis habitation comparatur. Et ideo cum Angelis et Archangelis, cum Thronis et Dominationibus, cumque omnia militia caelestis exercitus, hymnum gloriae tuae canimus, sine fine dicentes:

## Communion

Esdr. 2: 34, 35

Lux aeterna luceat eis, Domine, cum sanctis tuis in aeternum, quia pius es. Requiem aeternam dona eis Domine, et lux perpetua luceat eis, quia pius es.

## Postcommunion

Praesta, quaesumus, omnipotens Deus: ut anima famuli tui (vel famulae tuae) N., quae hodie de hoc saeculo migravit, his sacrificiis purgata, et, a peccatis expedita, indulgentiam partier et requiem capiat sempiternam. Per Dominum nostrum Jesum Christum Filium tuum, qui tecum vivit et regnat in unitate Spiritus Sancti, Deus: per omnia saecula saeculorum.

## Dismissal

V. Requiescant in pace.

R. Amen.

## Absolution when the body is present

Non intres in judicium cum servo tuo, Domine, quia nullus apud te justificabitur homo, nisi per te omnium peccatorum ei tribuatur remissio. Non ergo eum, quaesumus, tua judicalis sententia premat, quem tibi vera supplicatio fidei christianae commendat: sed, gratia tua illi succurente, mereatur evadere judicium ultionis, qui dum viveret, insignitus est signaculo sanctae Trinitatis: Qui vivis et regnas in saecula saeculorum.

R:  Amen.

R: Libera me, Domine, de morte aeterna, in die illa tremenda: Quando caeli movendi sunt et terra: Dum veneris judicare saeculum per ignem.

V: Tremens factus sum ego, et timeo, dum discussio venerit, atque ventura ira.

R: Quando caeli movendi sunt et terra: Dum veneris judicare saeculum per ignem.

V: Dies illa, dies irae, calamitatis et miseriae: dies magna et amara valde.

R: Dum veneris judicare saeculum per ignem.

V: Requiem aeternam dona ei, Domine, et lux perpetua luceat ei.

R:  Libera me, Domine, de morte aeterna, in die illa tremenda: Quando caeli movendi sunt et terra: Dum veneris judicare saeculum per ignem.

V: Et ne nos inducas in tentationem.

Deus, cui proprium est miserere semper et parcere, te supplices exoramus pro anima famuli tui (vel famulae tuae), N. quam hodie de hoc saeculo migrare jussisti: ut non tradas eam in manus inimici, neque obliviscaris in finem, sed jubeas eam a sanctis Angelis suscipi, et ad patriam paradisi perduci; ut, quia in te speravit et credidit, non paenas inferni sustineat, sed gaudia aeterna possideat. Per Christum Dominum nostrum. 

R: Amen.

In paradisum deducant te Angeli: in tuo adventu suscipiant te Martyres, et perducant te in civitatem sanctam Jerusalem, Chorus Angelorum te suscipiat, et cum Lazaro quondam paupere aeternam habeas requiem.

# The Mass for the Dead 

## Introit

Esdr. 2: 34, 35

Eternal rest give unto them, O Lord. And let perpetual light shine upon them. A hymn, O God, becometh Thee in Zion and a vow shall be paid to thee in Jerusalem. Hear my prayer. All flesh shall come before you.

## Collect

O God, Whose property is ever to have mercy and to spare, we humbly entreat Thee on behalf of the soul of Thy servant (handmaid) N., whom Thou hast bidden this day to pass out of this world: that Thou wouldst not deliver him  into the hands of the enemy, nor forget him for ever, but command him to be taken up by the holy angels, and to be borne to our home in Paradise, that as he had put his faith and hope in Thee, he may not undergo the pains of Hell but may possess everlasting joys. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who liveth and reigneth with Thee, in the unity of the Holy Ghost, God, world without end.

## Epistle

1 Thess. 4: 13-18

Brethren: We will not have you ignorant concerning them that are asleep, that you be not sorrowful, even as others who have no hope; for, if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, them who have slept through Jesus will God bring with Him. For this we say unto you in the word of the Lord, that we who are alive, who remain unto the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent them who have slept. For the Lord Himself shall come down from Heaven, with commandment, and with the voice of an Archangel, and with the trumpet of God; and the dead who are in Christ shall rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, shall be taken up together with them in the clouds to meet Christ, into the air, and so shall we be always with the Lord. Wherefore comfort ye one another with these words.

## Gradual

Esdr. 2: 34, 35

Eternal rest grant unto them, O Lord: and let perpetual light shine upon them. He shall be justified in everlasting memory, and shall not fear evil reports.

## Tract

Forgive, O Lord, the souls of all the faithful departed from all the chains of their sins and by the aid to them of your grace may they deserve to avoid the judgment of revenge, and enjoy the blessedness of everlasting light.

## Sequence

This day, this day of wrath

shall consume the world in ashes,

as foretold by David and the Sibyl.

What trembling there will be

When the judge shall come

to weigh everything strictly!

The trumpet, scattering its awful sound

Across the graves of all lands

Summons all before the throne.

Death and nature shall be stunned

When mankind arises

To render account before the judge.

The written book shall be brought

In which all is contained

Whereby the world shall be judged

When the judge takes his seat

all that is hidden shall appear

Nothing will remain unavenged.

What shall I, a wretch, say then?

To which protector shall I appeal

When even the just man is barely safe?

King of awful majesty

You freely save those worthy of salvation

Save me, found of pity.

Remember, gentle Jesus

that I am the reason for your time on earth,

do not cast me out on that day

Seeking me, you sank down wearily,

you saved me by enduring the cross,

such travail must not be in vain.

Righteous judge of vengeance,

award the gift of forgiveness

before the day of reckoning.

I groan as one guilty,

my face blushes with guilt;

spare the suppliant, O God.

Thou who didsn't absolve Mary 

and hear the prayer of the thief

hast given me hope, too.

My prayers are not worthy,

but Thou, O good one, show mercy,

lest I burn in everlasting fire,

Give me a place among the sheep,

and separate me from the goats,

placing me on Thy right hand.

When the damned are confounded

and consigned to keen flames,

call me with the blessed.

I pray, suppliant and kneeling,

a heart as contrite as ashes;

take Thou my ending into Thy care.

That day is one of weeping,

on which shall rise again from the ashes

the guilty man, to be judged.

Therefore spare this one, O God,

merciful Lord Jesus:

Give them rest. Amen.

## Gospel

John 11: 21-27

At that time: Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if Thou hadst been here, my brother had not died: but now also I know that whatsoever Thou wilt ask of God, God will give it Thee. Jesus saith to her, Thy brother shall rise again. Martha saith to Him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. Jesus saith to her, I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in Me, although he be dead, shall live; and every one that liveth and believeth in Me, shall not die for ever. Believest thou this? She saith to Him, Yea, Lord, I have believed that Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God, Who art come into this world.

## Offertory

Lord Jesus Christ, king of glory, deliver the souls of all the faithful departed from the pains of Hell and the bottomless pit. Deliver them from the jaws of the lion, lest hell engulf them, lest they be plunged into darkness; but let the holy standard-bearer Michael lead them into the holy light, as once you promised to Abraham and to his seed. Lord, in praise we offer you Sacrifices and prayers, accept them on behalf of those who we remember this day: Lord, make them pass from death to life, as once you promised to Abraham and to his seed.

## Agnus Dei

O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world, grant them rest. O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world, grant them rest. O Lamb of God, that takest away the sins of the world, grant them eternal rest.

## Secret

Be merciful, we beseech Thee, O Lord, to the soul of Thy servant N., for whom we offer to Thee the sacrifice of praise, humbly entreating Thy Majesty: that, by this service of pious atonement, he may deserve to attain to eternal rest. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who is God, and liveth and reigneth with Thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost, world without end. Amen.

## Preface

It is truly meet and just, right and for our salvation, that we should at all times and in all places give thanks to Thee, holy Lord, Father almighty, eternal God, through Christ our Lord: in Whom the hope of a blessed resurrection hath beamed upon us: so that those who are saddened by the certainty of dying may be consoled by the promise of a future deathless life. For to Thy faithful people, Lord, life is changed, not taken away; and when the home of this earthly sojourn is dissolved, an eternal dwelling is made ready in Heaven. And therefore with Angels and Archangels, with Thrones and Dominations, and with all the hosts of the Heavenly army, we sing a hymn to Thy praise, evermore saying:

## Communion 

Esdr. 2: 34, 35

Let everlasting light shine upon them, Lord, with Thy saints for ever, for Thou art merciful. Grant them eternal rest, Lord, and let perpetual light shine upon them, for Thou art merciful.

## Postcommunion

Grant, we beseech Thee, Almighty God, that the soul of Thy servant N., who, this day, has departed out of this world, being purified by this sacrifice and delivered from his sins, may receive both pardon and everlasting rest. Through our Lord Jesus Christ, Thy Son, Who is God, and liveth and reigneth with Thee in the unity of the Holy Ghost, world without end.

## Dismissal

V. May they rest in peace.

R. Amen.

## Absolution when the body is present

Enter not into judgement with Thy servant, O Lord; for, save Thou grant him forgiveness of all his sins, no man shall be justified in Thy sight. Wherefore, suffer not, we beseech Thee, the sentence Thou pronouncest in judgement upon one whom the faithful prayer of Christian people commends to Thee, to be a doom which shall crush him utterly. Rather, succour him by Thy gracious favour, that he may escape Thine avenging justice who, in his lifetime, was signed with the seal of the Holy Trinity: Who livest and reignest, world without end. 

R:  Amen.

R: Deliver me, O Lord, from death eternal in that awful day. When the heavens and the earth shall be moved: When Thou shalt come to judge the world by fire.

V: Dread and trembling have laid hold on me, and I fear exceedingly because of the judgement and of the wrath to come.

R: When the heavens and the earth shall be moved: When Thou shalt come to judge the world by fire.

V: O that day, that day of wrath, of sore distress and of all wretchedness, that great day and exceeding bitter.

R: When Thou shalt come to judge the world by fire.

V: Eternal rest grant unto him/her, O Lord, and let light perpetual shine upon him/her ..

R:  Deliver me, O Lord, from death eternal in that awful day. When the heavens and the earth shall be moved: When Thou shalt come to judge the world by fire.

Incense is spooned, and the Priest blesses it, saying:

Be blessed by Him in Whose honour Thou art burnt. Amen.

Lord, have mercy. Christ, have mercy. Lord, have mercy.

Priest: Our Father, (all continuing together) Who art in Heaven, Hallowed by Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us, . . .

V: And lead us not into temptation.

R:  But deliver us from evil.

V: From the gate of Hell.

R:  Deliver his soul, O Lord.

V: May he rest in peace.

R:  Amen.

V: O Lord, hear my prayer.

R:  And let my cry come unto Thee.

V: The Lord be with you.

R:  And with thy spirit.

O God, Whose property is ever to have mercy and to spare, we humbly entreat Thee on behalf of the soul of Thy servant N., whom Thou hast bidden this day to pass out of this world: that Thou wouldst not deliver him into the hands of the enemy, nor forget him for ever, but command him to be taken up by the holy angels, and to be borne to our home in Paradise, that as he had put his faith and hope in Thee, he may not undergo the pains of Hell but may possess everlasting joys. Through our Lord Jesus Christ.

R: Amen.

May the angels lead thee into Paradise: may the martyrs receive thee at Thy coming, and lead thee into the holy City of Jerusalem. May the Choir of angels receive thee, and mayest thou have eternal rest with Lazarus, who once was poor.

Let Thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication.

For with Thee, there is merciful forgiveness, and by reason of Thy law, I have waited upon Thee, O Lord.

My soul hath relied on His word: my soul hath hoped in the Lord.

For, with the Lord, there is mercy, and with Him, plentiful redemption.
