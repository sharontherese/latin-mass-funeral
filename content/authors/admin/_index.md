Traditional Catholic funerals, when celebrated in full, comprise 4 parts. 

1. The Procession of the body to the church
2. The Office of the Dead 
3. The Requiem Mass 
4. THe Rite of Burial 

These should all follow the sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick (also called last rites, or extreme unction).

There are an enormous amount of resources on traditional Catholic funerals, partly because - as the list above shows - there are so many diverse events involved (the Office, the Mass, rites, the sacrament, the procession, etc.). Deep concern for the care of departed souls has resulted in an enormous amount of supplementary material on funerals, such as multiple masses for the anniversaries of the deceased, prayers on the day of death, special propers for the death of clergy, prayers for the deceased's family, and blessings for nearly every object involved, from the moments preceding death to years after the death. 

To complicate matters, the funeral and burial of children follow different rules. The Rite of Burial is different than that of the one for adults, the requiem mass is not said, and the rubrics are different. 

Rather than organizing the resources here by category, such as all requiem Masses, all funeral rites, etc., the resources are organized by event. Everything connected to funerals for adults is in one place. Everything for funerals for children is in one place. Following the layout of my other sacrament websites, all other resources are either under "Start Here" (glossary, FAQ, about), and "Planning" (rubrics, music, prayers, etc.).
