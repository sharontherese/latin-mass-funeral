# About

Funerals are necessarily connected to suffering, grieving, dying, purgatory, redemption, the end of the world, and of course, the four last things: Death, Judgment, Heaven and Hell. 

Like many other topics on this website, these are impossibly broad. Each person faces the reality of death, so as long as humans have existed, they have grappled with this reality in Scriptural commentaries, fiction, theology, poetry, art, and works of meditation. 

Below is a collection of resources on the four last things that hopefully reflect the long tradition and the diversity of Catholic thought. 

Many more resources can be found at Fish Eaters, EWTN, the Catholic Portal, the Catholic News Archive, and e-Catholic 2000.
