# About

Like many things in the Catholic faith, the Rite of Burial for Children seems, at first glance, counterintuitive. No Requiem Mass is said, the vestments are white, not black, and no prayers are said for the souls of the child. Because it is assumed that the child did not commit any actual sin, in the eyes of Heaven this occasion is one of "praise and thanksgiving": 

> The rite given here for the burial of a child is not to be regarded as a prayer of petition of the Church for the soul of the child. Rather, it is to be seen as a prayer of praise and thanksgiving to God for having taken the child to the glory and happiness of everlasting life.[^2]

Further commentary and description of the rite are available at New Liturgical Movement.[^9]

For more information about the loss of a child, see [Latin Mass Baptism](https://latinmassbaptism.com/loss-of-a-child/). 

I have formatted a Latin-English version of the rite below:
